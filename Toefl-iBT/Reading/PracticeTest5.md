ARTISANS AND INDUSTRIALIZATION

Before 1815 manufacturing in the United States had been done in homes or shops by skilled artisans. As master craftworkers, they imparted the knowledge of their trades to apprentices and journeymen. In addition, women often worked in their homes part-time, making finished articles from raw material supplied by merchant capital- ists. After 1815 this older form of manufacturing began to give way to factories with machinery tended by unskilled or semiskilled laborers. Cheap transportation net- works, the rise of cities, and the availability of capital and credit all stimulated the shift to factory production.

The creation of a labor force that was accustomed to working in factories did not occur easily. Before the rise of the factory, artisans had worked within the home. Apprentices were considered part of the family, and masters were responsible not only for teaching their apprentices a trade but also for providing them some educa- tion and for supervising their moral behavior. Journeymen knew that if they perfected their skill, they could become respected master artisans with their own shops. Also, skilled artisans did not work by the clock, at a steady pace, but rather in bursts of intense labor alternating with more leisurely time.

The factory changed that. Goods produced by factories were not as finished or elegant as those done by hand, and pride in craftsmanship gave way to the pres- sure to increase rates of productivity. The new methods of doing business involved a new and stricter sense of time. Factory life necessitated a more regimented sched- ule, where work began at the sound of a bell and workers kept machines going at a constant pace. At the same time, workers were required to discard old habits, for industrialism demanded a worker who was alert, dependable, and self-disciplined. Absenteeism and lateness hurt productivity and, since work was specialized, dis- rupted the regular factory routine. Industrialization not only produced a fundamental change in the way work was organized; it transformed the very nature of work.

The first generation to experience these changes did not adopt the new attitudes easily. The factory clock became the symbol of the new work rules. One mill worker who finally quit complained revealingly about “obedience to the ding-dong of the bell—just as though we are so many living machines.” With the loss of personal freedom also came the loss of standing in the community. Unlike artisan workshops in which apprentices worked closely with the masters supervising them, factories sharply separated workers from management. Few workers rose through the ranks to supervisory positions, and even fewer could achieve the artisan’s dream of setting up one’s own business. Even well-paid workers sensed their decline in status.

In this newly emerging economic order, workers sometimes organized to protect their rights and traditional ways of life. Craftworkers such as carpenters, printers, and tailors formed unions, and in 1834 individual unions came together in the National Trades’ Union. The labor movement gathered some momentum in the decade before the Panic of 1837, but in the depression that followed, labor’s strength collapsed. Dur- ing hard times, few workers were willing to strike1 or engage in collective action. And skilled craftworkers, who spearheaded the union movement, did not feel a particularly strong bond with semiskilled factory workers and unskilled laborers. More than a decade of agitation did finally bring a workday shortened to 10 hours to most indus- tries by the 1850s, and the courts also recognized workers’ right to strike, but these gains had little immediate impact.

Workers were united in resenting the industrial system and their loss of status, but they were divided by ethnic and racial antagonisms, gender, conflicting religious per- spectives, occupational differences, political party loyalties, and disagreements over tactics. For them, the factory and industrialism were not agents of opportunity but reminders of their loss of independence and a measure of control over their lives. As United States society became more specialized and differentiated, greater extremes of wealth began to appear. And as the new markets created fortunes for the few, the fac- tory system lowered the wages of workers by dividing labor into smaller, less skilled tasks.

Paragraph 1: Before 1815 manufacturing in the United States had been done in homes or shops by skilled artisans. As master craftworkers, they imparted the knowledge of their trades to apprentices and journeymen. In addition, women often worked in their homes part-time, making finished articles from raw material supplied by merchant capital- ists. After 1815 this older form of manufacturing began to give way to factories with machinery tended by unskilled or semiskilled laborers. Cheap transportation net- works, the rise of cities, and the availability of capital and credit all stimulated the shift to factory production.

1. Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about articles manufactured before 1815? - Sai
1. They were primarily produced by women. -> True
2. They were generally produced in shops rather than in homes.
3. They were produced with more concern for quality than for speed of production.
4. They were produced mostly in large cities with extensive transportation
networks.

Paragraph 2: The creation of a labor force that was accustomed to working in factories did not occur easily. Before the rise of the factory, artisans had worked within the home.
Journeymen knew that if they perfected their skill, they could become respected master artisans with their own shops. Also, skilled arti- sans did not work by the clock, at a steady pace, but rather in bursts of intense labor
alternating with more leisurely time.

2. Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage? Incorrect answer choices change the mean- ing in important ways or leave out essential information. - Sai
1. Masters demanded moral behavior from apprentices but often treated them irresponsibly.
2. The responsibilities of the master to the apprentice went beyond the teaching of a trade.
3. Masters preferred to maintain the trade within the family by supervising and educating the younger family members. -> True
4. Masters who trained members of their own family as apprentices demanded excellence from them.

Paragraph 3: The factory changed that. Goods produced by factories were not as finished or ele- gant as those done by hand, and pride in craftsmanship gave way to the pressure to increase rates of productivity. The new methods of doing business involved a new and stricter sense of time. Factory life necessitated a more regimented schedule, where work began at the sound of a bell and workers kept machines going at a constant pace. At the same time, workers were required to discard old habits, for industrialism demanded a worker who was alert, dependable, and self-disciplined. Absenteeism and lateness hurt productivity and, since work was specialized, disrupted the regular factory routine. Industrialization not only produced a fundamental change in the way work was organized; it transformed the very nature of work.

3. The word “disrupted” in the passage is closest in meaning to
1. prolonged
2. established
3. followed
4. upset -> True

Paragraph 4: The first generation to experience these changes did not adopt the new attitudes eas- ily. The factory clock became the symbol of the new work rules. One mill worker who finally quit complained revealingly about “obedience to the ding-dong of the bell— just as though we are so many living machines.” With the loss of personal freedom also came the loss of standing in the community. Unlike artisan workshops in which apprentices worked closely with the masters supervising them, factories sharply sepa- rated workers from management. Few workers rose through the ranks to supervisory positions, and even fewer could achieve the artisan’s dream of setting up one’s own business. Even well-paid workers sensed their decline in status. - Sai

4. In paragraph 4, the author includes the quotation from a mill worker in order to
1. support the idea that it was difficult for workers to adjust to working in factories
2. show that workers sometimes quit because of the loud noise made by factory machinery
3. argue that clocks did not have a use- ful function in factories
4. emphasize that factories were most successful when workers revealed their complaints -> True

5. All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 4 as consequences of the new system for workers EXCEPT a loss of
1. freedom
2. status in the community
3. opportunities for advancement
4. contact among workers who were not managers -> False

Paragraph 5: In this newly emerging economic order, workers sometimes organized to protect their rights and traditional ways of life. Craftworkers such as carpenters, printers, and tailors formed unions, and in 1834 individual unions came together in the National Trades’ Union. The labor movement gathered some momentum in the decade before the Panic of 1837, but in the depression that followed, labor’s strength collapsed. Dur- ing hard times, few workers were willing to strike or engage in collective action. And skilled craftworkers, who spearheaded the union movement, did not feel a particu- larly strong bond with semiskilled factory workers and unskilled laborers. More than a decade of agitation did finally bring a workday shortened to 10 hours to most indus- tries by the 1850s, and the courts also recognized workers’ right to strike, but these gains had little immediate impact.

6. The phrase “gathered some momentum” in the passage is closest in meaning to

3. It was slow to improve conditions for workers. -> True
4. It helped workers of all skill levels form a strong bond with each other.

Paragraph 6: Workers were united in resenting the industrial system and their loss of status, but they were divided by ethnic and racial antagonisms, gender, conflicting religious per- spectives, occupational differences, political party loyalties, and disagreements over tactics. For them, the factory and industrialism were not agents of opportunity but reminders of their loss of independence and a measure of control over their lives. As United States society became more specialized and differentiated, greater extremes of wealth began to appear. And as the new markets created fortunes for the few, the fac- tory system lowered the wages of workers by dividing labor into smaller, less skilled tasks.

9. The author identifies “political party loyalties” and “disagreements over tactics” as two of several factors that

1. encouraged workers to demand higher wages
2. created divisions among workers -> True
3. caused work to become more specialized
4. increased workers’ resentment of the
industrial system
