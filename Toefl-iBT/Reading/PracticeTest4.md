AGGRESSION
When one animal attacks another, it engages in the most obvious example of aggres- sive behavior. Psychologists have adopted several approaches to understanding aggressive behavior in people.

The Biological Approach. Numerous biological structures and chemicals appear to be involved in aggression. One is the hypothalamus, a region of the brain. In response to certain stimuli, many animals show instinctive aggressive reactions. The hypo- thalamus appears to be involved in this inborn reaction pattern: electrical stimula- tion of part of the hypothalamus triggers stereotypical aggressive behaviors in many animals. In people, however, whose brains are more complex, other brain structures apparently moderate possible instincts.

An offshoot of the biological approach called sociobiology suggests that aggres- sion is natural and even desirable for people. Sociobiology views much social behav- ior, including aggressive behavior, as genetically determined. Consider Darwin’s theory of evolution. Darwin held that many more individuals are produced than can find food and survive into adulthood. A struggle for survival follows. Those individu- als who possess characteristics that provide them with an advantage in the struggle for existence are more likely to survive and contribute their genes to the next genera- tion. In many species, such characteristics include aggressiveness. Because aggres- sive individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce, whatever genes are linked to aggressive behavior are more likely to be transmitted to subsequent generations.

The sociobiological view has been attacked on numerous grounds. One is that people’s capacity to outwit other species, not their aggressiveness, appears to be the dominant factor in human survival. Another is that there is too much variation among people to believe that they are dominated by, or at the mercy of, aggressive impulses.

The Psychodynamic Approach. Theorists adopting the psychodynamic approach hold that inner conflicts are crucial for understanding human behavior, including aggression. Sigmund Freud, for example, believed that aggressive impulses are inevitable reactions to the frustrations of daily life. Children normally desire to vent aggressive impulses on other people, including their parents, because even the most attentive parents cannot gratify all of their demands immediately. Yet children, also fearing their parents’ punishment and the loss of parental love, come to repress most aggressive impulses. The Freudian perspective, in a sense, sees us as “steam engines.” By holding in rather than venting “steam,” we set the stage for future explo- sions. Pent-up aggressive impulses demand outlets. They may be expressed toward parents in indirect ways such as destroying furniture, or they may be expressed toward strangers later in life.

According to psychodynamic theory, the best ways to prevent harmful aggres- sion may be to encourage less harmful aggression. In the steam-engine analogy, ver- bal aggression may vent some of the aggressive steam. So might cheering on one’s favorite sports team. Psychoanalysts, therapists adopting a psychodynamic approach, refer to the venting of aggressive impulses as “catharsis.”1 Catharsis is theorized to be a safety valve. But research findings on the usefulness of catharsis are mixed. Some
studies suggest that catharsis leads to reductions in tension and a lowered likelihood of future aggression. Other studies, however, suggest that letting some steam escape actually encourages more aggression later on.

The Cognitive Approach. Cognitive psychologists assert that our behavior is influ- enced by our values, by the ways in which we interpret our situations, and by choice. For example, people who believe that aggression is necessary and justified—as dur- ing wartime—are likely to act aggressively, whereas people who believe that a partic- ular war or act of aggression is unjust, or who think that aggression is never justified, are less likely to behave aggressively.

One cognitive theory suggests that aggravating and painful events trigger unpleasant feelings. These feelings, in turn, can lead to aggressive action, but not automatically. Cognitive factors intervene. People decide whether they will act aggres- sively or not on the basis of factors such as their experiences with aggression and their interpretation of other people’s motives. Supporting evidence comes from research showing that aggressive people often distort other people’s motives. For example, they assume that other people mean them harm when they do not.

Paragraph 2: The Biological Approach. Numerous biological structures and chemicals appear to be involved in aggression. One is the hypothalamus, a region of the brain. In response to certain stimuli, many animals show instinctive aggressive reactions. The hypo- thalamus appears to be involved in this inborn reaction pattern: electrical stimulation of part of the hypothalamus triggers stereotypical aggressive behaviors in many animals. In people, however, whose brains are more complex, other brain structures apparently moderate possible instincts.

1. According to paragraph 2, what evidence indicates that aggression in animals is related to the hypothalamus?
-> Theo đoạn 2, Chứng cứ nào thể hiện sự hung hãn của những động vật là liên quan đến tiểu não?
1. Some aggressive animal species have a highly developed hypothalamus -> Vài chủng vật hung hãn có 1 cấu trúc tiểu não phát triển
2. Electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus delays animals’ inborn reaction patterns -> Kích thích điện tĩnh của tiêu não dẫn trì hoãn cấu trúc phản ứng bẩm sinh của động vật
3. Animals behaving aggressively show increased activity in the hypothalamus -> Hành xử hung hãn của động vận chỉ sự gia tăng hoạt động của tiểu não (electrical stimulation of part of the hypothalamus triggers stereotypical aggressive behaviors in many animals) -> True
4. Animals who lack a hypothalamus display few aggressive tendencies -> Động vật thiếu tiểu não dẫn ít xu hướng hung hãn

Paragraph 3: An offshoot of the biological approach called sociobiology suggests that aggression is natural and even desirable for people. Sociobiology views much social behavior, including aggressive behavior, as genetically determined. Consider Darwin’s theory of evolution. Darwin held that many more individuals are produced than can find food and survive into adulthood. A struggle for survival follows. Those individuals who possess characteristics that provide them with an advantage in the struggle for exis- tence are more likely to survive and contribute their genes to the next generation. In many species, such characteristics include aggressiveness. Because aggressive indi- viduals are more likely to survive and reproduce, whatever genes are linked to aggres- sive behavior are more likely to be transmitted to subsequent generations.
2. According to Darwin’s theory of evolution, members of a species are forced to struggle for survival because
1. not all individuals are skilled in finding food
2. individuals try to defend their young against attackers
3. many more individuals are born than can survive until the age of reproduction -> True
4. individuals with certain genes are more likely to reach adulthood

Paragraph 5: The Psychodynamic Approach. Theorists adopting the psychodynamic approach hold that inner conflicts are crucial for understanding human behavior, including aggres- sion. Sigmund Freud, for example, believed that aggressive impulses are inevitable reactions to the frustrations of daily life. Children normally desire to vent aggressive impulses on other people, including their parents, because even the most attentive parents cannot gratify all of their demands immediately. Yet children, also fearing their parents’ punishment and the loss of parental love, come to repress most aggres- sive impulses. The Freudian perspective, in a sense, sees us as “steam engines.” By holding in rather than venting “steam,” we set the stage for future explosions. Pent-up aggressive impulses demand outlets. They may be expressed toward parents in indi- rect ways such as destroying furniture, or they may be expressed toward strangers later in life.

6. According to paragraph 5, Freud believed that children experience conflict between a desire to vent aggression on their parents and
1. a frustration that their parents do not give them everything they want

1. People who believe that they are fighting a just war act aggressively while those who believe that they are fighting an unjust war do not.
2. People who believe that aggression is necessary and justified are more likely to act aggressively than those who believe differently. -> True
3. People who normally do not believe that aggression is necessary and justified may act aggressively during wartime.
4. People who believe that aggression is necessary and justified do not necessarily act aggressively during wartime.
