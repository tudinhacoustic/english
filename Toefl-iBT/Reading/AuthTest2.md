GEOLOGY AND LANDSCAPE

Most people consider the landscape to be unchanging, but Earth is a dynamic body, 
and its surface is continually altering—slowly on the human time scale, but relatively 
rapidly when compared to the great age of Earth (about 4.5 billion years). There are 
two principal influences that shape the terrain: constructive processes such as uplift, 
which create new landscape features, and destructive forces such as erosion, which 
gradually wear away exposed landforms.

Hills and mountains are often regarded as the epitome of permanence, successfully resisting the destructive forces of nature, but in fact they tend to be relatively 
short-lived in geological terms. As a general rule, the higher a mountain is, the more 
recently it was formed; for example, the high mountains of the Himalayas are only 
about 50 million years old. Lower mountains tend to be older, and are often the 
eroded relics of much higher mountain chains. About 400 million years ago, when 
the present-day continents of North America and Europe were joined, the Caledonian 
mountain chain was the same size as the modern Himalayas. Today, however, the 
relics of the Caledonian orogeny (mountain-building period) exist as the comparatively low mountains of Greenland, the northern Appalachians in the United States, 
the Scottish Highlands, and the Norwegian coastal plateau. 

The Earth’s crust is thought to be divided into huge, movable segments, called 
plates, which float on a soft plastic layer of rock. Some mountains were formed as a 
result of these plates crashing into each other and forcing up the rock at the plate margins. In this process, sedimentary rocks that originally formed on the seabed may be 
folded upwards to altitudes of more than 26,000 feet. Other mountains may be raised 
by earthquakes, which fracture the Earth’s crust and can displace enough rock to produce block mountains. A third type of mountain may be formed as a result of volcanic 
activity which occurs in regions of active fold mountain belts, such as in the Cascade 
Range of western North America. The Cascades are made up of lavas and volcanic 
materials. Many of the peaks are extinct volcanoes. 

Whatever the reason for mountain formation, as soon as land rises above sea 
level it is subjected to destructive forces. The exposed rocks are attacked by the various weather processes and gradually broken down into fragments, which are then 
carried away and later deposited as sediments. Thus, any landscape represents only 
a temporary stage in the continuous battle between the forces of uplift and those of 
erosion. 

The weather, in its many forms, is the main agent of erosion. Rain washes away 
loose soil and penetrates cracks in the rocks. Carbon dioxide in the air reacts with the 
rainwater, forming a weak acid (carbonic acid) that may chemically attack the rocks. 
The rain seeps underground and the water may reappear later as springs. These 
springs are the sources of streams and rivers, which cut through the rocks and carry 
away debris from the mountains to the lowlands. 

Under very cold conditions, rocks can be shattered by ice and frost. Glaciers may 
form in permanently cold areas, and these slowly moving masses of ice cut out valleys, carrying with them huge quantities of eroded rock debris. In dry areas the wind 
is the principal agent of erosion. It carries fine particles of sand, which bombard 
exposed rock surfaces, thereby wearing them into yet more sand. Even living things 
contribute to the formation of landscapes. Tree roots force their way into cracks in rocks and, in so doing, speed their splitting. In contrast, the roots of grasses and other 
small plants may help to hold loose soil fragments together, thereby helping to prevent erosion by the wind.
