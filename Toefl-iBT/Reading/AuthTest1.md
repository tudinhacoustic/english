NINETEENTH-CENTURY POLITICS IN THE UNITED STATES 
The development of the modern presidency in the United States began with Andrew 
Jackson, who swept to power in 1829 at the head of the Democratic Party and served 
until 1837. During his administration he immeasurably enlarged the power of the 
presidency. “The President is the direct representative of the American people,” he 
lectured the Senate when it opposed him. “He was elected by the people, and is 
responsible to them.” With this declaration, Jackson redefined the character of the 
presidential office and its relationship to the people. 

During Jackson’s second term, his opponents had gradually come together 
to form the Whig Party. Whigs and Democrats held different attitudes toward the 
changes brought about by the market, banks, and commerce. The Democrats tended 
to view society as a continuing conflict between “the people”—farmers, planters, and 
workers—and a set of greedy aristocrats. This “paper money aristocracy” of bankers and investors manipulated the banking system for their own profit, Democrats 
claimed, and sapped the nation’s virtue by encouraging speculation and the desire for 
sudden, unearned wealth. The Democrats wanted the rewards of the market without 
sacrificing the features of a simple agrarian republic. They wanted the wealth that the 
market offered without the competitive, changing society; the complex dealing; the 
dominance of urban centers; and the loss of independence that came with it. 

Whigs, on the other hand, were more comfortable with the market. For them, 
commerce and economic development were agents of civilization. Nor did the Whigs 
envision any conflict in society between farmers and workers on the one hand and 
businesspeople and bankers on the other. Economic growth would benefit everyone 
by raising national income and expanding opportunity. The government’s responsibility was to provide a well-regulated economy that guaranteed opportunity for citizens 
of ability. 

Whigs and Democrats differed not only in their attitudes toward the market but 
also about how active the central government should be in people’s lives. Despite 
Andrew Jackson’s inclination to be a strong President, Democrats as a rule believed 
in limited government. Government’s role in the economy was to promote competition by destroying monopolies1 and special privileges. In keeping with this philosophy 
of limited government, Democrats also rejected the idea that moral beliefs were the 
proper sphere of government action. Religion and politics, they believed, should be 
kept clearly separate, and they generally opposed humanitarian legislation. 

The Whigs, in contrast, viewed government power positively. They believed that it 
should be used to protect individual rights and public liberty, and that it had a special 
role where individual effort was ineffective. By regulating the economy and competition, the government could ensure equal opportunity. Indeed, for Whigs the concept 
of government promoting the general welfare went beyond the economy. In particular, Whigs in the northern sections of the United States also believed that government 
power should be used to foster the moral welfare of the country. They were much 
more likely to favor social-reform legislation and aid to education. 

In some ways the social makeup of the two parties was similar. To be competitive 
in winning votes, Whigs and Democrats both had to have significant support among 
farmers, the largest group in society, and workers. Neither party could win an election 
by appealing exclusively to the rich or the poor. The Whigs, however, enjoyed disproportionate strength among the business and commercial classes. Whigs appealed 
to planters who needed credit to finance their cotton and rice trade in the world market, to farmers who were eager to sell their surpluses, and to workers who wished 
to improve themselves. Democrats attracted farmers isolated from the market or 
uncomfortable with it, workers alienated from the emerging industrial system, and 
rising entrepreneurs who wanted to break monopolies and open the economy to newcomers like themselves. The Whigs were strongest in the towns, cities, and those 
rural areas that were fully integrated into the market economy, whereas Democrats 
dominated areas of semisubsistence farming that were more isolated and languishing 
economically.
